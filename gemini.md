# Project Context & Guidelines

## User Goals
- **Future Study:** User plans to study a Master's degree in 'System Integration of Processes in Healthcare' at CTU (ČVUT).
  - *Relevance:* The bachelor thesis should emphasize reliability, standardization, and governance of autonomous agents, as these are critical in healthcare systems.

## Collaboration Rules
- **Authorship:** The AI agent strictly DOES NOT write the bachelor thesis (BP) text for the user.
- **Role:** The AI's role is limited to discussion, analysis, brainstorming, and technical assistance. The user is the sole author of the thesis content.
