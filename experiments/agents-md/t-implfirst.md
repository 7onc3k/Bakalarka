## Testing

Implement the core functionality first, focusing on correct behavior
according to the specification. After the implementation stabilizes,
write a comprehensive test suite:

1. Cover each acceptance criterion with at least one test.
2. Add edge-case tests for boundary conditions.
3. Derive expected values from the specification, not from code.

**Constraint:** Do not skip writing tests. Every acceptance criterion
must have a corresponding test before you are done.
