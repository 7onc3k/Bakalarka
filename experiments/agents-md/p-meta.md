## Planning & Design

Before writing implementation code, design the solution structure —
what components will exist, what their responsibilities are, and how
data flows between them.

**Why:** Upfront design prevents ad-hoc structural decisions during coding.
Without explicit architecture, implementations grow inconsistently and
become difficult to change. Agents that skip design produce monolithic
code with tangled dependencies.

**Constraint:** Do not start writing implementation code until you have
documented your design decisions.
