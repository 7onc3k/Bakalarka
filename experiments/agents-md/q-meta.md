## Quality Infrastructure

Set up automated quality feedback before implementing business logic —
checks for correctness and consistency, meaningful test coverage requirements,
and continuous integration that enforces standards on every change.

**Why:** Automated quality gates catch problems earlier than manual review.
Without feedback loops, errors accumulate undetected and tests may achieve
high coverage while missing real bugs.

**Constraint:** Do not implement business logic without functioning
automated quality checks.
