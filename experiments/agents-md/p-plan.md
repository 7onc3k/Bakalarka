## Planning

Before writing any implementation code, create a short design document:
1. List the modules/files you will create and their responsibilities.
2. Define the key data types and their relationships.
3. Sketch the public API (function signatures, inputs, outputs).

Update this document as your understanding evolves.

**Constraint:** Do not start writing implementation code until you have
documented your design decisions.
