## Planning

Do not create a separate plan or design document.
Start by creating a minimal runnable project skeleton and iterate
from there. Let the design emerge from working code and tests.

Refactor as needed when patterns become clear.

**Constraint:** Do not spend time on upfront planning artifacts;
focus on getting code running quickly.
